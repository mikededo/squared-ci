      Ever felt lost in GitHub Actions&apos; complexity? I get itâ€”I&apos;ve been
      there too. As the sole developer behind this project, I&apos;ve created
      this roadmap as your companion in this CI/CD journey. GitHub Actions
      Builder is all about making the intimidating task of creating action.yaml
      files a breeze.
      <br />
      This roadmap is my commitment to simplifying this process for you. No
      jargon, no confusionâ€”just a clear path to creating GitHub Actions. Join me
      in this adventure, and let&apos;s demystify the world of GitHub Actions
      together. Stay tuned for updates; your GitHub Actions experience is about
      to get a whole lot smoother! Happy coding (or not)! ðŸš€
